# BandeDessinee_website_MERN

This a the final project of my formation.

A website using MERN that allow you to register, connect (with session) and manage you collection of Bande dessinées.

There is a forum and you can create groups with others users.
The purpose of the website is to create a list of the bande dessinées you possess (name of the serie, tome, title, authors, year of publication) and share it with members of your group.
You can add a review of the bande dessinée. 
When you want to add a new bande dessinée to the collection, a research is made to see if it has already been registrated and simplify the registration of the collection. The more members add their collection, the more the database will have data for user and make their experience easier.

Members can also add reviews and create events related to bandes dessinées.

There is an administartor section who controls evrything and can add partners for advertising or commercial events

Their is a CRUD for members, bande dessinée, events
